.TH TEXDVI 1 "4/29/85"
.SH NAME
.PP
.I texdvi
\- run TeX on a file and then preview it.
.SH SYNOPSIS
texdvi texfile[.tex]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I texdvi
runs a TeX processor on texfile.
texdvi expects to be called pdvi where p is the name of the processor
to run on texfile.
Thus, latexdvi runs latex on texfile and slitexdvi runs slitex on
texfile.
Other macro packages may be utilized by creating the appropriate
link to texdvi.
the .tex suffix to texfile is optional.
if the TeX job creates an updated dvifile, texdvi then previews the
dvifile using dvitool.
if the TeX job had errors as signified by TeX's return status and TeX
wrote out a new .dvi file, texdvi will ask Jill user if she wants to 
preview this dvi file.
if there is a dvitool running, a request is sent to it to re-read the
dvifile.  if no dvitool is running, one is created.
.PP
texdvi is an attempt to minimize the number of keystrokes necessary to
perform an iteration of the edit-TeX-preview cycle.
customizable editors (emacs, jove) can be set up to run texdvi on
the buffer being edited so that the cycle can be started with two
keystrokes.
.PP
.SH "SEE ALSO"
tex(1), latex(1), slitex(1), dvitool(1)
.SH BUGS
since texdvi uses dvitool(1) which cannot be run outside of the SUN
window system, texdvi is only useful in that context.
.PP
if the user specifies an output file inside of TeX due to an error
writing the default dvi file, texdvi will not display the updated
dvifile as it has no way of knowing the new output name.
