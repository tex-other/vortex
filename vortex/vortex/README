			Getting Started With VorTeX

First of all, some basic familiarization: the source editor (the part of
the system which the user interacts with) is modeled loosely on the EMACS
editor originally written by Richard Stallman.  Uses of EMACS should find
the VorTeX, although much less rich in commands than EMACS has become.

You must be running X10 for VorTeX to work.  Then, you should be able to
run the bin/vortex.  To start editing a TeX document (plain TeX for now),
run the following commands (in this example, the file d.tex contains the
entire TeX source for the document):

	C-x C-f d.tex
	M-x make-document d.tex
	M-x proof-docuent

After some processing (and assuming there are no errors), you should have
both the source buffer d.tex viewing the TeX source and the buffer
*proof* showing the formatted output.  As you edit in the source buffer,
the changes are sent to the formatter, which continuously reformats the
immediately surrounding document.  To see the changes reflected in the
proof window, move the mouse into it and type space.

In the source window, key strokes have the normaly text editing functions.
However, in the proof window, quite different commands make sense.  The
C-c keymap is used globally for special VorTeX commands (for example,
C-c f is bound to proof-change-font so, when typed in a proof window, it
will allow you to change the font of the current selection (see below)
in the style of a WYSIWYG system, mapping the change into changes to the
TeX source.

Most proof editor commands operate on the current selection, which is
defined with the mouse buttons in the proof window or the emacs point/mark
paradigm in the source.  The left button marks the structure underneath
the mouse cursor as the start of the selection (any previous selection is
un-selected).  Successive clicks of the left button with the cursor at the
same location, cause successivly larger (more enclosing) to become selected.
For example, one click selects a letter, two a word, three a paragraph.
The middle button extends the current selection to include the area under
the mouse cursor at the same level of structure as selected by left button.
Thus, clicking the left button twice will select a word, then moving the
mouse and clicking the middle button one will select all words between and
including the one under the current cursor position.

The current selection can also be set from the source buffer.  The command
C-c . selects the letter in the proof window which corresponds to the
text character just before the source window cursor.  This selection is
just like the left button and can be enlarged and extended with the mouse
buttons as described above.  This is typically used to show the proofed
version of the current source position.  C-c . also scrolls the source
buffer to the TeX source which corresponds to the current selection.
