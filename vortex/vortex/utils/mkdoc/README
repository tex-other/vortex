    Mkdoc prepares documentation from lisp and C source files for
either a printed manual or the on-line info facility.  The program
takes as its argument a list of C and/or vlisp source files,
searching for documentation comments (described in "doc-format").
The ``documentation strings'' found are read into memory.  Once all
the documentation has been collected, the entries are alphabetically
sorted and then output in the appropriate form.

    By default, mkdoc creates an ASCII database on its standard
output which is suitable to be read in by the VorTeX vlisp comment
"load-docstr".  Once a documentation string file has been loaded in
this way, the entries it contains can be accessed through the help
mechanism.

    If the -f option is given to mkdoc, a TeX source file is produced
which can be processed with TeX to produce a typeset manual of all
the documentation entries found in the source comments.  The .tex
fiel produced in this way needs to be able to \input the macro file
docmac.tex in this directory.  This .tex file should be \input into
a larger document that eventually calls \bye to end it all.
