\section{The Editing Paradigm}

In order to implement the functionality required, we decided to use an
``internal representation'' which was equivalent neither to the source text
of a {\TeX} document nor the primitive typesetting commands of a {\tt dvi}
file.  We needed something that could represent both, and ultimately be
mapped back into the {\TeX} source.  However, due to the lack of structure
of {\TeX} source, this was impractical although we did manage to achieve
approximately the same functionality.

\subsection{Our Problems with \TeX}

The largest problem is that there is very little underlying structure to
{\TeX}.  There is a form of scoping (groups, delimited by {\tt \{} and {\tt
\}}).  And one can imagine words and symbols as children of paragraphs, but
the scoping is not bound into the logical structure and there is no control
over side-effects.  All control structures and user definitions are done
with macros, which may be changed at any time.  In fact, a {\TeX} program
may change the reader syntax conditionally.

Thus, it is not practical to get completely away from the text-based
structure.  We could not design an internal representation that would
allow us to generate correct and reasonable {\TeX} source from some
abstract representation of a document.  Thus, in the implementation,
we ended up with an internal representation which is used to map
between the basic representations of the document, the ``source''
({\TeX} code) and the ``proof'' (e.g., {\tt dvi} command).

The terminology used denotes the tree-based internal representation as
the {\IRI} and the source text representation (basically {\ASCII} text)
as the {\IRS} and the target representation (images to print or display)
as the {\IRT}.  Basically, the ``internal representation'' is a tree
with the interior nodes representing logical structure (pages, paragraphs
and words) and the leaves pointing to the {\TeX} source which implements
it.  The tree also has links (filled in as necessary) into the {\IRT}
at all levels.

Thus, we end with a system which appears as through it has a fundamental
representation, but is actually a way to map the logical and display
elements back into the source stream.  We cannot make a change in the
proof editor and fix up the text, we must use the {\IRI} to map the
change back into the source and then re-format the portion of the
document which has been changed.  This then fixes the {\IRI} and {\IRT}.

\subsection{What We Have Done}

We make it appear as through the user can edit either in the source
using {\EMACS} commands or on an image of the formatted document using
WYSIWYG\note{WYSIWYG--What You See Is What You Get.}-style commands.
The source updates instantly and the representations are kept
synchronized.  When editing on the proof, it synchronizes after each
editing operation.  When editing the source, merely typing space
synchronizes the proof representation.

\subsection{Separation of Responsibility}

The source editor is responsible for maintaining the most basic representation
of the document, the {\TeX} program text.  Since {\VorTeX} operations on the
typical {\UNIX} paradigm (read in files, edit and write them back), the only
representation stored externally is the source text.  During its execution
the formatter will have a current copy of the source, its own {\IRI} and
information on the {\IRT}.  The proof editor will also have it's own cache
of the {\IRT} (page-level granularity) and other command-state and selection
information.

{\tt vortex}, the source editor, can run with or without the other two
processes.  In fact, starting up {\tt VorTeX} does not automatically start
those daemon programs.  The user may explicitly start the formatter with
{\tt start-formatter} or the proof editor with {\tt start-proof-editor} or
implicitly with {\tt format-document} or {\tt proof-document} respectively.
{\tt make-document} starts up the formatter, transmits the entire contents
of the {\TeX} document (possibly more than one file) and begins treating the
source buffer(s) as part of the WYSIWYG system.

Editing in a buffer which is part of the formatted document causes the
source editor to send the changes to the formatter.  However, due to the
possibility of syntactic inconsistencies, the formatter will not reorganize
the {\IRI} until the user explicitly requests it with {\tt format-document}.
The command {\tt format-document} will only send the changed characters from
the document's source buffers and trigger an incremental re-format.  The
user is expected to format the document often, whenever he wishes to see the
formatted version.  In fact, a version of the system could be built which
would request formatting every time the user made a change to the source
(although we think this would be prohibitively slow).

To understand the following descriptions one must keep in mind the fact
that the system only truly maintains the source text of the document.
The formatter translates this into the proof version with which {\VorTeX}
can display the formatted document and translates what little structure
there is in the formatted representation back into the source text stream.

\subsection{The Selection is the Thing}

All proof editing works based on the ``current selection.''  In the
{\EMACS} paradigm, the current region is defined by the point and most
recent mark.  In the proof editor, the selection is defined by selecting
one or more pieces of the document at some level of structure.  Assuming
that these all come from some ordered, contiguous portion of the source
document, the proof selection can be mapped back into the source text
as an {\EMACS} region.

Making a selection in the proof editor, causes it to send the selection
back to the source editor.  The proof selection is available to Lisp
programs through the command {\tt proof-selected-region}, which returns
the current proof selection as an {\EMACS} region (plus the buffer name).
The Lisp functions which implement the WYSIWYG commands use this mechanism
to set up the current buffer, point and mark and then use {\EMACS}
editing commands to make the change.

The proof selection can also be set from the source editor by translating
point and mark into a list of characters for the proof editor to display.
This mechanism is not used much, but the trivial case, selecting a single
character, is very useful for finding the current position in the other
representation ({\tt C-x .} is bound, in both editors, to a function
which selects the current point in the other editor).

This has the advantage of being easy to extend, since writing a Lisp
function is all that is required, although the lack of any true
knowledge of the document makes more sophisticated transformations
impractical.

\subsection{The Mapping Mechanism}

The proof editor maintains a copy of the {\IRT} which associates {\TeX}
boxes with {\tt dvi}-style output primitives.  It can paint a window with
the glyphs and rules to display the formatted output and translate the
mouse cursor position into a formatter box~ID.  These {\IRI} box~IDs
may represent terminals (characters), called \tbox es, or logical
structure (words, paragraphs and pages), called \nbox es.

Each character in the {\IRS} is tagged with a unique ID which allows the
source editor to translate \tbox~IDs as sent from the proof editor into
source buffer positions which can be used for editing.  Thus, when the
proof editor sends the selection as a pair of \tbox~IDs, the source
editor requests the corresponding buffer/region from the formatter
and sets up the data returned by {\tt proof-selected-region}.
