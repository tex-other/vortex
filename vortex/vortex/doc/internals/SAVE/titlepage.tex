{\narrower\narrower

\noindent {\VorTeX} is an interactive document preparation system
based on the {\TeX} system. {\TeX} allows finer control and produces
higher quality typesetting than the other systems commonly available
on {\UNIX}.  {\VorTeX} makes these features more accessible through
integration with a powerful editor, an incremental {\TeX} processor
and a what-you-see-is-what-you-get output displayer.

The first version of {\VorTeX} is nearly finished and has
shown us what problems our early assumptions and the design have
produced.  This document describes the internals of the system from
the point of view of the {\VorTeX} source editor (the user interface).
Since {\VorTeX} is written in three separate pieces, this paper does
not describe the architecture of the entire system.  However, it
does document most of the interfaces within the system.
