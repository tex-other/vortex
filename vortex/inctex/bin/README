This directory has support routines for inctex.
Inctex creates 1 dvi file per page.
"inctex" & "inclatex" are scripts that run itex and ilatex,
incremental tex & latex.
"mergepages" is a script that looks for all
the dvi files in (the default subdirectory) INC
and runs mergedvi to combine them all.
!! These 3 scripts will require paths to various objects to be
set properly, either by pathname or search rules.

dvicompare and vline are support scripts used by
../trip/tripmakefile; they are used in the incremental
TRIP TeX acceptance tests.

Mergedvi must be built, the sources are in the
subdirectory merge.

merge/lib has library routines needed to build a
library module called lib.a:
    cd merge/lib
    make

merge/dvi has the mergedvi source:
    cd merge/dvi
    make
    ...move mergedvi wherever you would like it,
    probably to this bin directory, then modify
    ./mergepages so that it finds mergedvi properly.

Acknowledgements:
mergedvi was adapted from Univ. of Maryland's dviselect
program, the library routines are courtesy of U. of Maryland.
