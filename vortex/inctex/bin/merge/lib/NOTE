There are two VAX-dependent file in this directory:

- bcopy.s	block copy routine.  You can simply remove this from
		the Makefile if you are running 4.2; bcopy is already
		provided.

- bzero.s	block zero routine.  As above.

There is one more system-dependent file:

- error.c	error and panic routines.  These make calls to stdio
		internals, except on System V or other machines on
		which there are `vprintf' routines.  Define HAVE_VPRINTF
		if you have the vprintf routines.

See the manuals for the parameters to these.
